Coordinating the blogging team transcended mere task management. It was about nurturing a sense of community among our volunteers and amplifying the voices of the participants. It was about capturing the human narratives behind the code, the late-night hack-fueled brainstorming sessions, and the enduring friendships forged in the collaborative spirit of the hackathon.
